# Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repo.

## Install

To install, run the following commands:

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install git stow
```

Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install git stow
```

Then run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:igorpoubel/dotfiles.git
```

```bash
cd dotfiles
```

```bash
./init_installs.sh
```

Maybe you need to run the following command:

```bash
chmod a+x init_installs.sh
```
